# [Limeth's thoughts](https://limeth.keybase.pub/)

This is the repository of my blog.
It is published via the [Keybase filesystem](https://keybase.pub/), but conveniently, also accessible from [GitHub pages](https://limeth.github.io/).

## Building

Run `bundle exec jekyll -d destination_dir` to build the site.
Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to view it.
